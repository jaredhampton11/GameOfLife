# GameOfLife
This is a java implementation of "Conway's Game of Life". A board is generated based on the given height, width, and percentage of living cells. New generations are generated until the given generation limit is reached. These new generations utilize the following rules: 
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
